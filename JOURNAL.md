# August 1st-2nd, 2025 (we like working at midnight pf)

I got most of the schematic done! I just need to figure out what type of io i'll use (uh probably just pin headers?) and i'll be done!!!! \
Now comes the routing.... aaaaa

# August 2nd, 2025 (Part II)

I attributed all of the footprints to the symbols after some research and converted my board to a pcb!
I spent a good hour trying to debugging why i couldn't see the GND net when trying to make a plane (even cyao told me it was over :sob:) but i finally found it was because of another net connected to the GND that renamed it!
I also changed the symbol from the easyeda one to the official one for more legibility + added headers to expose the gpios! \
