# Clicky devboard

This is a devboard based on the RP2350 chip (the rp2040's successor) with three mechanical switches, with every gpio exposed on pin headers + extras like 3v3 and vbus. It was entirely designed in Kicad and everything is open source! 4 layer board that can be manufactured with normal jlcpcb tolerances.
